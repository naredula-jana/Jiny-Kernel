Short term :
- rewriting wait in kernel/task
- cleaning defines 
- including header files in .S files
- locking @ inode level  

Long term :	
- implementing useful system calls 
- code reorg:
- init functions streamlining
- enhancing debugging,logging and shell features 	

Running Linux program:
- syscalls proper implementation as linux and adding any syscall related fs
DONE - enable & disabling the prints by variable
DONE - chnaging filep to fd , and removing the ut_printf
---------------------------------------------------------
fixes:
 1) when system call number more then max limit, raising pagefault
  2) argv strings in sys_execve should be multiples of 8 , otherwise stack pointer is not getting the multiples of 8
  3) auxilary vector need to added after the environment variable
