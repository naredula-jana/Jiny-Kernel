Short term :
- rewriting wait in kernel/task
- cleaning defines 
- including header files in .S files
- locking @ inode level  

Long term :	
- implementing useful system calls 
- code reorg:
- init functions streamlining
- enhancing debugging,logging and shell features 	

Running Linux program:
- syscalls proper implementation as linux and adding any syscall related fs

---------------------------------------------------------
fixes:
 1) when system call number more then max limit, raising pagefault
  2) argv strings in sys_execve should be multiples of 8 , otherwise stack pointer is not getting the multiples of 8
  3) auxilary vector need to added after the environment variable
------------------------------
p9 :
  - unhandled interrupt-15
  - fseek , stats , close, closing fids, 
  - interpreting qid 
----------------------------------  

 for executing userland program(busybox ):
1) pagecache: freeing and allocating pagecache page by incrementing/decrementing usage count.
2) fs_seek in loading elf not implemented
3) while mapping stack address hardcoded, it may collide with other maps in user program
 4) while reading the file contents, getting stuck @ paging.c:468
5) fs segment register is currently used only for user application, during app switching the content should be modified in schedule function
