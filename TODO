executing userland program(busybox ):
1) pagecache: freeing and allocating pagecache page by incrementing/decrementing usage count.
2) fs_seek in loading elf not implemented
3) while mapping stack address hardcoded, it may collide with other maps in user program
4) while reading the file contents, getting stuck @ paging.c:468
5) fs segment register is currently used only for user application, during app switching the content should be modified in schedule function
6) printf are not getting triggered immedietly but at triggered when the user level thread is getting exit, looks something buffering @ libc.
7) thread clean when exit/context switch: 
            a) xmm registers are cleaned
            b) es,ds registers are used by user threads , need to reload back to kernel when it switched to kernel threads
    
8) Handling swapgs when the control is moving from level 0 to 3 and viceversa:  This may be cause for problem-4(getting stuck while reading p9 data)

----------------------------------------------------------
Task.c or scheduler
1) moving architecture depended code in architecture specific area.
2) standising exit errors(currently SYS_sys_exit(..), storing exit error in task
---------------------------------------------------------
Running user app BusyBox, long term solution :
1) CTRL-C and CTRL-D not working
2) hard link : redesign of VFS by introducing directory entry between file and inode layers.
3) if there are more entries in directory, empty is returning.

---------------------------------------------------------
Display 
1) checking validty of virtual addresses presence in pagetable before displaying, otherwise a junk address in ut_printf can cause a pagefault with spinlock(printf_lock) on.
--------------------------------------

LWIP /Network
- arch api need to re-implement to suit newer version
- delition of buffer while sending and recving the packet.
- network app like telnet not working.
---------------------------------------------------------
fixes:
 1) when system call number more then max limit, raising pagefault
 2) argv strings in sys_execve should be multiples of 8 , otherwise stack pointer is not getting the multiples of 8

------------------------------
p9 :
  - fseek, closing fids, 
  - interpreting qid 
  - ERROR in writing
 -------------------------------
 Userspace Related:
  -retreving large number of files from the directory fails.
  -implementing pipe and redirecting to file for user space.
  - protect kernel space when user space task is running, user thread can access kernel space, 
----------------------------------
debug:
   - printing arguments at the start of function
   - uninstalling breakpoint on the fly from user shell, currently it thoughs error
   - call_stats : to seggregate base on the submodules 
-------------------------------
   - implementing dmesg
   - cleaning init path and proper printing
   - when log is enabled to file, the content is overwriting in to someother pages that causing execute to fail to load by elf.

----------------------------------   
High CPU consumption:
 -after running some application that consume high cpu , APIC timer(248) stop receving on some cores, this stopped after recving any intterupt like keyboard, till that point the cpu consumpton is very 
 high.
