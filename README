JINY KERNEL   (JINY : Jana's tINY  toy kernel)

1) WHAT IS JINY?.
 Jiny is a small foot print Toy kernel, It is yet another Unix based kernel. It will be specialised more for virtual machine environment but can also use on baremetal. 
  
2) ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?
 It was fully tested for x86-64. partially done for x86-32.

3) For What purpose JINY will be used initially?
 JINY will be used initially 
	a) To model the page cache(MRU+LRU) suitable for hadoop like applications.
	b) To model Host based filesystem(HFS): HFS is filesystem run in guest OS but does file i/o using the shared memory between the guest and host os. HFS does not need any block drivers, it communicated with block devices using the shared memory between guest and host OS.  
	c) Benchmarking virtio net performance.
	d) To model Centralised page cache shared by different vm's.
------------------------------------------

The goals of the project are:
	1) It should be monalitic unix based kernel with a small footprint. 
	2) powerful command line and debug environment.
	3) Higly modularise:  To define well defined interface between subsystems.
	4) Virtualization features:  Virtualization features like virtio,xen para drivers, Elastic CPU and Elastic memory.
	5) Running directly linux application like  Busy box on top of jiny as it is, for this need support almost all system call. (partially completed).

------------------------------------------
Feature Currently Available:

Page Cache: 
   - LRU and MRU based (based on the below published paper)
   
File System: 
   - 9p
   - Host based file system based on ivshm(Inter Vm Shared Memory) 
   
Virtualization:
   - Elastic Cpu's:
       - depending on the load, some of the cpu's will be rested.
       - todo: disabling IPI interrupts for a in-active cpu.
       
   - Elastic Memory:
       - depending on the load, some amount of physical memory can be disabled, so as host/other vm's can use.
       - todo: using common pool memory for pagecache, currently there are two pools of memory one for pagecache, second for rest.
       
Virtualization drivers:
    - Xen : xenbus, network driver using xen paravirtualised.
    - KVM : virtio + P9 filesystem
    - KVM : virtio + Network (test server with udp stack(tcp/ip))
    - KVM : virtio + memory ballooning
    - KVM : clock
      
SMP:
   - APIC,MSIX
   
Networking:
   - XEN: TCP/IP stack(from LWIP) integrated with XEN paravirtualised Network driver .
   - KVM + LWIP4.0

User level:
   - user app(ring-3) can run in user mode without libc and without shared libs.
   - bustbox can shell command and file related apps.

    
TODO Features:
  - Elastic CPU's: and Elastic Memory todo's       
  - Centralised page cache.
  - Syscalls: Implementing advanced syscalls like futex etc :Running advanced apps in busybox, currently all file related apps(ls ,cat,cp ..etc) can be run.
