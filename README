JINY KERNEL 0.1  (JINY : Jana's tINY  toy kernel)

1) WHAT IS JINY?.
 Jiny is a small foot print Toy kernel, initally will be running on a virtual environment and with limited functionality on a baremetal. It is designed to run efficently with small foot print on a virtual environment.
  
2) ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?
 It will be fully tested for x86-64. partially done for x86-32 but discontinued.

3) For What purpose JINY will be used initially?
 JINY will be used initially 
	a) To model the page cache(MRU+LRU) suitable for hadoop like applications.
	b) To model Host based filesystem(HFS): HFS is filesystem run in guest OS but does file i/o using the shared memory between the guest and host os. HFS does not need any block drivers, it communicated with block devices using the shared memory between guest and host OS.  
	c) Benchmarking virtio net performance.
------------------------------------------

The goals of the project are:
	1) It should be monalitic kernel with a small footprint: To keep kernel size small. This is done by writing paravirtualised drivers  if it not running on the bare metal. To begin with, file system is implemented  with a paravirtualised driver.
	2) powerful command line and debug environment.
	3) Higly modularise:  To define well defined interface between modules , so as any module can be replaced by keeping the interface same. (see include/interface.h for more details.
	4) virtualization features like virtio,xen para drivers, hot cpu plugin, hot mem plugin, hot network plugin.
	5) Running linux compiled Busy box application on top of jiny as it is. (partially completed).

------------------------------------------
Feature Currently Available:

Page Cache : 
   - LRU and MRU based (based on the research/published paper)
   
currently supported File System : 
   - 9p
   - Host based file system based on ivshm(Inter Vm Shared Memory) 
   
Virtualization:
    - Xen : xenbus, network driver using xen paravirtualised.
    - KVM : virtio + P9
    - KVM : virtio + Network (test server with udp stack(tcp/ip))
    - KVM : virtio + memory ballooning
   
Networking:
   - XEN: TCP/IP stack(from LWIP) integrated with XEN paravirtualised Network driver .

User level :
   - user app(ring-3) can run in user mode without libc and without shared libs.
   - small user app compiled with libc statically can RUN sucessfully.
SMP :
   - basic with 2 cpus's
   - APIC 
    
TODO Features:
  - cpu-hotplug
  - virtio+lwip
  - clock
  - memory-hotplug(partial - memory ballooning)
  - running busybox(partial):trying busybox with statically compiled(halfway)- implementing necessary system calls.

-----------------------------------------
page cache Algorithm based on paper:
      Every file is tagged as Long lived(LRU) or short lived(MRU). Based on the tag, the pages of file will processed differently in the page cache. Page cache algorithm tries to evacuate the Short lived files as soon as possible to create a space for the long lived files. From the Application point of view, a file is tagged by using fadvise call after the open call. This approach of tagging will help applications like hadoop to retain the temporary files as long as possible in dirty state before they are removed, this saves disk io both interms of read and write.

Data Structures:
	page : Every page containg age attribute, age is updated when ever the page is accessed(read) or dirted(write) depending on type of file.If age of page made eldest means page is going to evacuate from the system very soon. The value of age can varies from 1(youngest) to n(eldest). n is configirable default may be 100. 
	queues : active,inactive,LRU dirty,MRU dirty and free queue.

Tasks:
	1) when page is read:
		if it is MRU type the age is changed to eldest and moved to end of inactive list.
		if it is LRU it is changed to youngest and moved to end of acive list.
	2) when page is written:
		LRU dirty : if it is LRU type moved to end of LRU dirty queue and made youngest.
		MRU dirty : if it is MRU type, moved to end of MRU dirty queue and made eldest.
	3) when fle is synced using fdatasync:
		If the file is LRU: after flushing the page, the page is made youngest and queued at the end of active list.
		If the file is MRU: after flushing the page, the page is made eldest and queued at the end of inactive list.
	4) Background house keeper thread: flush the dirty pages and create enough free pages for page cache.
		a) It scans the pagetables periodically and updates the age.( this is needed only if the file is mmaped. TODO : currently partially implemented).
		b) flush MRU dirty queues: MRU dirty queue is flushed as soon as possible whenever disk bandwidth is available.
		c) flush LRU dirty queue LAZILY : It is flushed only when the page cache is running short of free pages and MRU dirty queue is empty or amount of LRU dirty pages execeed threshould.
					    
Interface functions:
	Initialization and stat:
		int pc_init(unsigned char *start_addr,unsigned long len);
		int pc_stats(char *arg1,char *arg2);
	When page is written:
		int pc_insertPage(struct inode *inode,struct page *page); /* this api is used while reading unpresent page  */
		int pc_removePage(struct page *page); 
		int pc_pageDirted(struct page *p);
	When page is flushed:
		int pc_pagecleaned(struct page *page);
	when page is read:
		struct page *pc_getInodePage(struct inode *inode,unsigned long offset);
	when empty page is needed:
		page_struct_t *pc_getFreePage();
	when page freed:
		int pc_putFreePage(struct page *page);
